This program is for the Assignment2 task2.
To generate a frequency of word txt file and two frequency Graphs based on the previously generated txt,
then stored all of them for further work.
There are 3 outputs:
1. File: vocab.txt;
2. Graph of frequency against first 100 words in sorted vocab;
3. Graph of words that occur n time against word occurrence.
